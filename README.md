# Brainstorm-Team---Project
Task: Design and implement a computer application or App for an online library system. A catalog of all books must be kept â€“ you can have categories (e.g. Computer Science, Mathematics, etc. or other categories). Library administrators can insert/amend/delete books/categories and print various reports (e.g. books currently on loan; books overdue for return). Users (e.g. students) can register at the library to lend/return books online. Include any other features/functions you may deem necessary to complete/improve the application, e.g. you can have a simulated checkout/payment step for paying fines.
